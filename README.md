# Our Solution Summary

This is an attempt to design a solution that leverages Azure AI Translator service to automate document transcreations to different languages. The idea is to integrate XM Cloud with Batch document translations service, where by documents are pushed from Media Library in bulk into Azure Blob storage. They are then translated in bulk and are stored in a staged location within Azure Blob storage. The XM Cloud can then pull those back into Media Libary, for delivery to a global audience. 

The vision is to enable businesses to take advantage of advances in AI natural language processing, and reduce costs and time it takes to transcreate business critical documents such as marketing material for their markets. Since Azure AI can translate documents whilst preserving their formats, this for me a the best use of AI to meet business needs.

I realise was a huge undertaking, but I have started building the various componets to deliver the vision. An Azure AI Services Func app microservice is located within the DocuTranslator subfolder.

## Sample transcreation output

Below is a sample pdf image that has been transcreated with this service. The document structure is preserved, but not sure about the font.

## Pre-requisites and Dependencies

⟹ Does your module rely on other Sitecore modules or frameworks?

- Azure AI Services Func app microservice, further details below


## Installation instructions
To run locally, refer to  'Development' section.
Then Use the Sitecore CLI to serialize items into local environemnt

 ```ps1
1. dotnet sitecore cloud login
2. dotnet sitecore connect --ref xmcloud --cm  https://xmcloudcm.localhost --allow-write true -n default
3. dotnet sitecore ser pull -n "default"
```


### Configuration
The Azure Func all solution requires the following settings to run locally. A sample [`local.settings.json`](src/DocuTranslator/TeamHorizon.DocuTranslator/local%20.settings-sample.json) has been included for reference
 ```ps1
1. "docu_translation_endpoint": "Azure AI services document translation endpoint, more details in Usage instructions below"
2. "azure_key": "Azure AI services document translation key"
3. "docu_source_uri": "The URL for the source container containing documents to be translated"
4. "docu_target_uri": "The URL for the target container to which the translated documents are written"
5. "docu_target_lang": "The language code for the translated documents, e.g., fr for French"
6. "funcapp_api_key":"Your custom function app API key"
 ```

## Usage instructions
⟹ Provide documentation about your module, how do the users use your module, where are things located, what do the icons mean, are there any secret shortcuts etc.

To invoke the Func app locally, create POST request using a tool like Postman, as shown below. Use `X-Api-Key` to pass API key on the header

Document Translation is only supported in the S1 Standard Service Plan (Pay-as-you-go) or in the D3 Volume Discount Plan. This service needs to be provisioned on Azure Portal

## XM Cloud Local setup
⟹ [Adopted from XM Cloud Starter Kit (Next JS)](https://github.com/sitecorelabs/xmcloud-foundation-head-staging)


1. In an ADMIN terminal:

    ```ps1
    .\init.ps1 -InitEnv -LicenseXmlPath "C:\path\to\license.xml" -AdminPassword "DesiredAdminPassword"
    ```

2. Restart your terminal and run:

    ```ps1
    .\up.ps1
    ```
